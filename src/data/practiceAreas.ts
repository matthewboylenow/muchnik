    fullDescription: `The cost of care to recuperate from an illness can deplete funds that took you a lifetime to put aside. But with a custom-tailored plan from Muchnik Elder Law, your assets can be preserved for you and for the people in your life who matter most.

The best time to start thinking about financing long-term care is before incapacity or the need for nursing home care or home care arises. That way, you have the time to think about what's most important to you and your family . . . time to clear up problems while they are manageable, before they become major obstacles . . . and time to choose from a broad range of planning options.

At Muchnik Elder Law, our goal is not only to be your counsel and advocate, but also to serve as a link between you and your family and a network of physicians, home care agencies, nursing homes and providers of assisted living arrangements.

As a Firm, we are committed to making the Medicaid eligibility application process easy to grasp, so that individuals and families understand how their existing health care benefits work, helping them to gain the greatest possible benefits from their existing medical insurance and receive all of the medical benefits to which they are entitled.

We also help clients and their families prepare for hospital discharge, home care services or nursing home admission. With advanced planning, problems can be identified and solved, eliminating delays, inconvenience and needless financial loss.

We help you gain the greatest benefit from your health care coverage at the lowest cost.`,

    shortDescription: 'Helping loved ones accomplish what they cannot accomplish independently',
    fullDescription: `A guardianship is a legal proceeding in which a Court appoints someone to act as a decision-maker for a person who is unable to manage their own affairs as a direct result of some medical condition or physical infirmity. When a guardianship is appropriate the Court will appoint a Guardian to make personal or financial decisions on behalf of a disabled adult.

Sometimes a guardianship proceeding is required when a young adult has serious developmental disabilities or traumatic brain injury. Sometimes a guardianship proceeding is required where formerly capable adults are no longer able to care for themselves or their property.

Guardianship proceedings are complex and have important consequences. At Muchnik Elder Law, we will help you successfully navigate through the guardianship process and understand your responsibilities as a court-appointed guardian.`,
